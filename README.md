# Dependencies

## Tailwind css
Tailwind CSS is primarily a utility-first CSS framework designed to assist in the development process.
It provides a set of utility classes that you can use to quickly build and style your user interface during development.

When it comes to deploying your application to a production environment, 
you usually compile and purge your CSS using tools like npm run build or equivalent commands.
The resulting CSS file generated by Tailwind CSS during the build process is what gets included in your production environment. 
However, the Tailwind CSS package itself is not typically required for the production runtime of your application. 
Therefore, it's considered a development dependency.

### Setup Tailwind --> https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app

To install all development dependencies in an npm project, you can use the following command:
```bash
    npm install --dev
```


To install all prod dependencies in an npm project, you can use the following command:
```bash
    npm install --prod
```

# React AutoGen ReadMe ("Cleanup if necessary")
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
